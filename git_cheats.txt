When the original Ultralytics repository updates, you can sync those changes into your fork:

# Fetch the latest changes from upstream
git fetch upstream

# Switch to the upstream-sync branch
git checkout upstream-sync

# Reset it to match the upstream's main branch
git reset --hard upstream/main

# Push the updated upstream-sync branch to your fork
git push origin upstream-sync --force


Then, to incorporate these updates into your main branch:

# Switch to your main branch
git checkout main

# Merge the updates from upstream-sync into main
git merge upstream-sync

# Resolve any conflicts if they arise, then commit

# Push the updated main branch to your fork
git push origin main
